Step 1: Clone / Download the CTPelvic1K repository from the github. This version is compatible with the Windows.  

Step 2: Unzip the downloaded folder

Step 3: Open the nnunet folder.

Step 4: Open the paths.py file

Step 5: On line 9, change the path to the folder where the dataset is stored.

Step 6: On line 31, adapt the folder path. The format would be something like ("C:\Users\akh\all_data_2\nnUNet")

Step 6a: Open Anaconda command prompt. Run the command (pip install -r requirements.txt) 

Step 6b: Go to the folder path where paths.py is located. Run paths.py from the command prompt

Step 7: Open the runs.py

Step 8: On line 10, adapt the path to the home directory.

Step 9: On line 11, adapt the path as per your system.

Step 10: On line 13, adapt the path as per your system.

#Step 11: Uncomment the code from line 53 to 62

Step 12: Place the nifti file in the C:\Users\akh\all_data_2\nnUNet\rawdata\nnUNet_raw_data\output\imagesTs folder created.
	 C:\Users\akh\all_data_2\nnUNet\rawdata\ipcai2021_ALL_Test (either the above or this path is correct)
	 Please adapt this path as per your system. Make sure to add a _0000.nii.gz as the suffix. This helps the network to
	 identify the modality of the data, here CT.

Step 13: Open the .pkl in the pretrained model folder. Unpickle the file and adapt the paths as per your system. Save the updated
	 pickle file. Place the pickle file at C:\Users\akh\all_data_2\nnUNet\nnUNet_results_folder\CTPelvic1K\2d\Task22_ipcai2021\nnUNetTrainer__nnUNetPlans\fold_0

Step 14: Now open the command prompt. Move to the folder nnunet. Type python paths.py. This will setup the folders. Now run runs.py.
	 This will start running the inference. 

Step 15: After the inference is complete, you can find the segmented data at C:\Users\akh\all_data_2\nnUNet\rawdata\ipcai2021_ALL_Test\Task22_ipcai2021__CTPelvic1K__fold0_2d_pred
